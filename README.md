# A Realtime Generative Drawing Canvas!
The Realtime Generative Drawing Canvas was the individual project for my IST 411 (Distrubuted-Object Computing) course at the Pennsylvania State University. The main emphasis of this project was to showcase a piece of artwork that continues to build upon itself with help from the community that accesses it via the web.

## Final Submission
**✓ Realtime Drawing**
 ✓ User can easily log in or create an account in order to start drawing. 
✓ Canvas is fully operational with useful tools (brush, square, circle, line, etc). 
✓ User is only able to draw for a defined timespan before receiving a timeout. 
✓ Canvas is still viewable if the timeout status is currently active; however, changes cannot be made until timeout resolves.  
✓ Additional features are apparent - user can save an image of the canvas, for example.
✓ Canvas supports multiple users, as in multiple users can interact with the canvas at the same time.


## Completed:
 
**✓Checkpoint 3:**  
 ✓ Users can draw for a certain amount of time before receiving a timeout (which is assigned to their account)
 ✓ Timeout prevents user from drawing on the canvas
 ✓ Canvas is persistent, drawings are now permanent

   **✓Checkpoint 2:**  
 ✓ User accounts are tied to database
✓ Login modal prompts user to login/create account before being able to make changes to canvas
 ✓ Additional canvas features such as lines and shapes can be used to draw
 
**✓ Checkpoint 1:**  
✓ On the homepage, the canvas is fully operational and its features are
   implemented - user can draw and use canvas to their liking.  Timeouts
   are not implemented.
