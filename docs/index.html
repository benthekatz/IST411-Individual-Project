    <p>The Realtime Generative Drawing Canvas was the individual project for my IST 411 (Distrubuted-Object Computing) course at the Pennsylvania State University. The main emphasis of this project was to showcase a piece of artwork that continues to build upon itself with help from the community that accesses it via the web.

    <p><strong>✓ Realtime Drawing</strong><br />
    ✓ User can easily log in or create an account in order to start drawing.<br />✓ Canvas is fully operational with useful tools (brush, square, circle, line, etc). ✓ User is only able to draw for a defined timespan before receiving a timeout. ✓ Canvas is still viewable if the timeout status is currently active; however, changes cannot be made until timeout resolves.<br /> ✓ Additional features are apparent - user can save an image of the canvas, for example.<br />✓ Canvas supports multiple users, as in multiple users can interact with the canvas at the same time.</p>

    <p><strong>✓Checkpoint 3:</strong><br> ✓ Users can draw for a certain amount of time before receiving a timeout (which is assigned to their account)<br /> ✓ Timeout prevents user from drawing on the canvas <br />✓ Canvas is persistent, drawings are now permanent</p>
    <p> <strong>✓Checkpoint 2:</strong><br> ✓ User accounts are tied to database ✓ Login modal prompts user to login/create account before being able to make changes to canvas ✓ Additional canvas features such as lines and shapes can be used to draw</p>
    <p><strong>✓ Checkpoint 1:</strong><br>✓ On the homepage, the canvas is fully operational and its features are implemented - user can draw and use canvas to their liking. Timeouts are not implemented.</p>
